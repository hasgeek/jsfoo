        <p class="secondary link-silent"><a href="http://hasgeek.com" class="orange" target="_blank">HasGeek</a> believes in diversity of participation at our conferences. We would like to make every effort to include members from underrepresented groups at our conferences. We have therefore introduced a grants programme for all our upcoming conferences.</p>
        <p class="secondary">Grants are intended to provide financial assistance and/or opportunities to members of these groups and enable them to participate in the community. We will make up to 5 grants available for every conference. Actual number of grants will be awarded depending on the quality of applications. Those who receive the grant will get to watch some of best speakers from the tech community talk about their craft and cutting edge technology.</p>
