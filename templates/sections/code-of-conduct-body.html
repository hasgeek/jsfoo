        <ol>
          <li><p>Sexual language, imagery and objectification of the male / female / trans-sexual body is not appropriate during talks. Refrain from using these in your slides. <em>Sexualization means objectification of human body, especially the female body, where the images, materials and activities are used for illustrative purposes as against being the content of discussion.</em></p></li>
          <li><p>Sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not acceptable.</p></li>
          <li><p>Every speaker must submit his/her slides a day before their presentation to ensure that they are in the clear.</p></li>
          <li><p>HasGeek crew reserves the right to stop a speaker during her/his talk if s/he makes overt or subtle remarks which violate this code of conduct.</p></li>
          <li><p>The offending speaker will be informed of their unacceptable remarks by the event coordinator, privately.

        <ol>
          <li><p>Exhibitors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material which objectify the male / female / trans-sexual body. For e.g., bikini-clad women, bodies of macho men, etc. <em>Sexualization means objectification of human body, especially the female body, where the images, materials and activities are used for illustrative purposes as against being the content of discussion.</em></p></li>
          <li><p>Efforts should also be made to refrain from using imagery and verbal remarks that can be interpreted as a certain gender’s incompetence /inability to understand and use technology.</p></li>
          <li><p>Images of men and women cannot be used in promotional material without specifying the exact context in which these images have to be interpreted. For e.g., use of a woman’s face for advertising job openings / recruitment is acceptable only if the woman is an employee of the company, and her name and designation are mentioned on the material.</p></li>
          <li><p>All designs – booth backdrop, print promotional material, videos – are subject to review before final printing and production. This is also explicitly mentioned in the commercial term sheet sent to every sponsor upon confirmation of sponsorship.</p></li>
          <li><p>Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p></li>
