And ECMAScript 5 doesn’t help, with many built-in string manipulation functions offering puzzling results. Security and the need for internationalization both throw these issues into stark relief. This talk highlights the many problems related to Unicode in JavaScript regular expressions, demonstrates how ES6 (aka. ECMAScript 2015) helps solve these issues, and explains how to polyfill in the mean time.</p>'

In this session we will start with the nodebots stack (how to use JS to control physical things such as sensors, actuators and robots) with some simple examples to get everyone up and running.</p><p>From there we will get into small teams to solve a challenge in a more free-flowing hack session over the course of the day, developing your skill with the stack by solving a problem. </p><p>We’ll then come together to see how well each team meets the challenge set out in a friendly show and tell or competition.Participants will leave having a good knowledge of the JS Hardware stack, how to start working with simple electronics using JavaScript and having designed and built a robot that meets a goal.</p>'
