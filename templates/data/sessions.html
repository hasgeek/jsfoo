      , 'bio': '<p>Andrew Fisher is a member of the core Johnny-Five team, the most used framework for JS + Hardware, and is the creator and lead maintainer of node-pixel, an open source project for controlling LEDs from JavaScript. He is a co-author of the book, &ldquo;Make: JavaScript Robotics&rdquo; and has helped organise and run NodeBots workshops for thousands of developers around the region including Australia, China and Sri Lanka. Andrew also helps design hardware for teaching NodeBots workshops. </p>\n<p>When not building robots, Andrew is the Chief Technology Officer and Head of Data Science for JBA, an Australian based consultancy focused on customer experience analysis and design.</p>'
      , 'objective': '<p>As the Internet of Things takes off, building devices that can operate in the physical world but can talk to the Web becomes an important part of the skills of the web developer.</p>\n<p>This workshop will provide a good foundation for how you can use JavaScript to be able to work with and build physical Internet Connected Things as well as Robots. </p>'
      , 'blurb'       : '<p>As well as being a great web language, JavaScript is well suited to working with the physical world too. </p>\n<p>This workshop will be a hands on exploration of NodeBots - a JS framework for building web connected, physical world things - culminating in a BattleBots session at the end of the day.</p><p>The session will start with an introduction to the nodebots stack covering how to use javascript to control physical things with examples focussed on some common tasks in order to get everyone up and running as quickly as possible.</p><p>From there we will get into small teams of 2-3 people and build a SimpleBot with the aim of competing in a Sumo Battle at the end of the day. SimpleBots are highly configurable and customisable, yet very straightforward wheeled robots designed for teaching. Augmented with some creativity and some code they are also great little battle bots.</p>\n<p>The Sumo battle challenge is designed to teach fundamentals of construction (physical and electronics), drive mechanisms and control and real world event handling, as well as being just lots of fun!</p><p>Participants will leave having a good knowledge of the JS Hardware stack, how to start working with simple electronics using JavaScript and having designed and built a robot based on requirements.</p><p>The hardware components for the workshop will be supplied. Participant Kit includes <ul><li>Arduino Nano</li><li>Jumper wires</li><li>Battery holder 4xAA</li><li>Ultrasonic sensor</li><li>Two CR Servos</li><li>Two Breadboards</li><li>USB cable</li><li>Chassis and wheels</li><li>Batteries</li><li>Two Microservos</li></ul></p>'
      ,'requirements': '<p>Participants should have an good knowledge of JavaScript and at least familiarity with NodeJS as these will be assumed knowledge. No assumptions are made regarding hardware or electronics knowledge as this will be covered in the session enough to get you going (if you&rsquo;re an electrical engineer you&rsquo;re welcome to come too though!).</p><p>All participants will need to have a laptop that can run nodejs and arduino on it. </p>'
