    , 'blurb' : '<p>JSFoo is India’s premier JavaScript conference. We launched JSFoo in 2011 as India’s first JavaScript conference. The JS community in India has grown phenomenally since then. JavaScript now pervades every aspect of web development – browsers, apps, front-end, backend, mobile and IoT.</p><p>In the last few years, JavaScript has evolved to become the centerpiece of a complex web stack. Today, the obsession lies with performance and speed. How can you get pages to load faster? How do you work with the constraints of browsers on desktop and mobile to enhance speed, and therefore the user’s experience?</p><p>How do you measure performance? What do you actually mean by performance when you set out to measure performance?</p><p>In what ways do faster response times influence your architecture choices and plans? How is this new focus on faster page loads and apps working offline influencing the development of front-ends and backends as well as server side JS?</p><p>This year JSFoo will happen on 15<sup class="tiny">th</sup> and 16<sup class="tiny">th</sup> September, at the <a href="#venue" class="darkyellow">MLR Convention Centre, Bangalore</a>.
