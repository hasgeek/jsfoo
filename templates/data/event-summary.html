The JS community in India has grown phenomenally since then. JavaScript now pervades every aspect of web development – browsers, apps, front-end, backend, mobile and IoT.</p><p>In the last few years, JavaScript has evolved to become the centerpiece of a complex web stack. Today, the obsession lies with performance and speed. And that will be our theme for the conference this year.</p><p>We will have talks focussed on ideas such as getting pages to load faster, working with the constraints of browsers on desktop and mobile to enhance speed and user experience, measuring performance and what that actually means, how faster response times influence architecture choices and plans, and many more.</p><p class="centered space-one-bottom">For more updates, follows us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jsfooindia" target="_blank" class="darkyellow">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jsfooindia" target="_blank" class="darkyellow">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hasgeek" title="Watch the latest videos from HasGeek" target="_blank" class="darkyellow">YouTube</a></p><p><a href="http://hasgeek.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c84c1486d2d6a025417c5d146&id=47afa263c6" target="_blank" class="block-link">Sign up</a> to receive updates and information about tickets, speakers, schedule and more.</p>'
